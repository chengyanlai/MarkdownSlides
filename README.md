# My Slides Tools

### [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org) Support
  Create a symlink of your local `MathJax` to `./MathJax`

### [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js.git)
  This is the best slide engine!!
  In order for this to work, we need to symlink some folders and files from the reveal.js repo.
  The script is provided elsewhere.
  Of cause, the reveal.js needs to be install completely by `npm install`.

### Custom CSS and other stuff
  Theme and columns layout.

### index.html
  Each branch will have its own `index.html` which is the main slide files.
  In `master` branch, the `index.html` is from original reveal.js with some modifications like local `MathJax'.
